## Stop losing tabs you meant to come back to

Prismi turns the most familiar page in your browser into a small system for the things you want to return to. Save a useful page instead of leaving another tab open as a reminder, give it a home in seconds, and pick up exactly where you left off.

Your collection is waiting in every new tab, ready when the next task starts.

## A calmer starting point

**Save what is worth keeping** - Save tabs, links, and notes while they are still useful, without keeping them open as reminders.

**Give every context a home** - Create boards for work, ideas, reading, or anything else that helps you think clearly.

**Find the thread again** - Your saved collection is always available on your new tab, so you can return to the right link when the next task begins.

**Make the space yours** - Choose a wallpaper, tune the colors, and add the small utilities that make a new tab useful from the first click.

**Search without leaving** - Find saved links or use the built-in search bar from the place where your next task begins.

**Import bookmarks** - Bring existing browser bookmarks into Prismi, keep the useful ones, and organize the rest.

## How it works

| Step | What to do |
|---|---|
| **1. Install** | Add Prismi from Firefox Add-ons or the Chrome Web Store. It becomes your new-tab page. |
| **2. Create a board** | Start with a context you return to, such as a project, reading list, or everyday tools. |
| **3. Save and return** | Save useful tabs, links, or notes in one click and find them again whenever you open a new tab. |

## Build From Source

This repository contains the editable source code for Prismi Dashboard v1.6.1. It does not include vendored third-party libraries or production build output.

### Requirements

- Windows 10 or later, macOS, or Linux
- Node.js 20.x or later
- npm 10.x or later (included with Node.js)
- Internet access to install the locked npm dependencies

Install Node.js 20 or later from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). npm is installed automatically with Node.js.

### Reproduce the Firefox build

From the root of this source package:

```bash
npm ci
npm run clean
npm run build
```

`npm ci` installs the exact dependency versions recorded in `package-lock.json` and applies the repository patches. `npm run build` generates the icons, checks the TypeScript source, hardens the supported third-party runtimes, and bundles the extension with Vite.

The resulting extension is written to `dist/`. The contents of `dist/` are the files to submit to Firefox Add-ons. No source files are transpiled, concatenated, minified, or generated in this source package; generated files are created only by `npm run build`.

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for the full build layout and verification notes.

## Compatibility

Prismi compatible on desktop Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Brave, and most Chromium-based browsers. Mobile browsers are not supported.

## Privacy

Prismi is free and private by design: no ads, tracking, accounts, subscriptions, or feature caps. It works fully offline, and your saved data remains under your control, stored locally in your browser, and can be exported.

Read the full [Privacy Policy](docs/PRIVACY.md).
